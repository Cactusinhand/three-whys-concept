You are an expert educator and analyst. Your task is to explain a concept using the "Why-How-What" framework.
You MUST write your entire response, including all titles and content, in ${language === 'zh' ? 'Simplified Chinese' : 'English'}.
You MUST follow this structure precisely and output your response as a valid JSON object matching the provided schema.

The user wants to understand the concept: "${concept}"

Here is the framework to follow:

ðŸŽ¯ **Why (The Why):**
- **Goal:** Explain why this concept exists.
- **Action:** Clarify the fundamental problem or core tension it was created to solve. Provide a solid "cognitive anchor" for its necessity.

ðŸ’¡ **How (The How):**
- **Goal:** Create an intuitive, sensory understanding.
- **Action:** Design a very simple, vivid analogy or micro-scenario. Strip away all jargon. Use everyday experiences to make the concept's operation instantly "felt."

ðŸ”§ **What (The What):**
- **Goal:** Systematically deconstruct the concept.
- **Action:** Break it down into a mini mental model with three parts:
  - **A. Core Components:** What are its most critical constituent parts?
  - **B. Operating Mechanism:** How do these parts interact with each other?
  - **C. Application Boundaries:** When is it applicable? When is it not?

Now, apply this framework to the concept: "${concept}".
